# git-aliae

A collection of git scripts and aliases.

Inspired by https://github.com/ConradIrwin/git-aliae, this repo provides some
additional git aliases.  In particular it focuses on much simpler incarnations of
`git filter-branch` for the most common filter-branch tasks.

# Installation

To install the git-aliae, just clone the repository to a known location (git clone git@github.com:Fryguy/git-aliae) and then add export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/git-aliae/bin to your ~/.bashrc.

If you also want to use the wip commands, then export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/git-aliae/wip in addition to the previous line.

Also feel free to just copy and paste commands into any directory that's already in your $PATH.
